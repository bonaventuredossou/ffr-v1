We aim to collect, clean and store corpora of Fon and French sentences for Natural Language Processing researches including Neural Machine Translation, Name Entity Recognition, etc. for Fon-French.

Fon (also called Fongbe) is an African-indigenous language spoken mostly in Benin, Togo and Nigeria - by about 2 million people.

As training data is crucial to the high performance of a machine learning model, the aim of this project is to compile the largest set of training corpora for the research and design of translation and NLP models involving Fon.

Through crowdsourcing, Google Form Surveys, we gathered and cleaned #25377 parallel Fon-French# all based on daily conversations.

The dataset is available under "Fon_French_Parallel_Data.txt" or/and "Fon_French_Parallel_Data_25377.csv".

To the crowdsourcing, creation, and cleaning of this version have contibuted:
